<p><h1>Shehroz Font</h1></p>



<p>I was free in my office and wished to have some fun, I decided to generate a custom font and here we go. This is my personal handwriting, or you can call this some kind of calligraphic font.</p>



<p>I have already uploaded the source file of this font. This is generated using FontForge and made this available under Open Font License.</p>



<p>Download it <a href="https://github.com/xehroz/Shehroz-Font/archive/refs/heads/main.zip">here</a>. Source Code is <a href="https://github.com/xehroz/Shehroz-Font">here</a>.</p>

<p>Feel free to have a look, you can always share your feedback via email at me AT shehroz DOT pk</p>
