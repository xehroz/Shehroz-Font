I was free in my office and decided to have some fun, I decided to a generate a custom font and here we go. This is my personal handwriting, or you can call this some kind of calligraphic font.

I have already uploaded the source file of this font. This is generated using FontForge and this is available under Open Font License.

Download it [here](https://github.com/xehroz/Shehroz-Font/archive/refs/heads/main.zip). Source Code is [here](https://github.com/xehroz/Shehroz-Font).

Feel free to have a look, you can always share your feedback via email at me AT shehroz DOT pk
